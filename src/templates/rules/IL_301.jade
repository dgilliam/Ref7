                  |Presumptions in General in Civil Actions and Proceedings<br /> <br />  In all civil actions and proceedings not otherwise provided for by rule, statute or court decision, a presumption imposes on the party against whom it is directed the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut or meet the presumption, but does not shift to such party the burden of proof in the sense of the risk of nonpersuasion, which remains throughout the trial upon the party on whom it was originally cast.<br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> Adopted September 27, 2010, eff. January 1, 2011.
