                <p style="white-space:pre-line;">(a) General Rule. For the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness, evidence that the witness has been convicted of a crime, except on a plea of nolo contendere, is admissible but only if the crime, (1) was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year under the law under which the witness was convicted, or (2) involved dishonesty or false statement regardless of the punishment unless (3), in either case, the court determines that the probative value of the evidence of the crime is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.<br /> <br />  (b) Time Limit. Evidence of a conviction under this rule is not admissible if a period of more than 10 years has elapsed since the date of conviction or of the release of the witness from confinement, whichever is the later date.<br /> <br />  (c) Effect of Pardon, Annulment, or Certificate of Rehabilitation. Evidence of a conviction is not admissible under this rule if (1) the conviction has been the subject of a pardon, annulment, certificate of rehabilitation, or other equivalent procedure, and (2) the procedure under which the same was granted or issued required a substantial showing of rehabilitation or was based on innocence.<br /> <br />  (d) Juvenile Adjudications. Evidence of juvenile adjudications is generally not admissible under this rule. The court may, however, allow evidence of a juvenile adjudication of a witness other than the accused if conviction of the offense would be admissible to attack the credibility of an adult and the court is satisfied that admission in evidence is necessary for a fair determination of the issue of guilt or innocence.<br /> <br />  (e) Pendency of Appeal. The pendency of an appeal therefrom does not render evidence of a conviction inadmissible. Evidence of the pendency of an appeal is admissible.<br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> Adopted September 27, 2010, eff. January 1, 2011.<br /> <br /> <br />  Rule 609 represents a codification of a draft of Fed.R.Evid. 609, as adopted by the Illinois Supreme Court in People v. Montgomery, 48 Ill.2d 510, 268 N.E.2d 695 (1971). Rule 609(d) is a codification of the Montgomery holding related to the admissibility of juvenile adjudications for impeachment purposes. Rule 609(d) may conflict with section 5–150(1)(c) of the Juvenile Court Act (705 ILCS 405/5–150(1)(c)), which arguably makes such adjudications admissible for impeachment purposes. Concerning that issue, it should be noted that in People v. Harris, 231 Ill. 2d 582 (2008), the Supreme Court held that juvenile adjudications are admissible for impeachment purposes when a defendant opens the door to such evidence (in that case, by testifying that “I don’t commit crimes”). Because of its holding, which was based on the defendant’s own testimony, the court declined to consider whether section 5–150(1)(c) overrides the common law prohibition against such use. The codification of Montgomery in Rule 609(d) is not intended to resolve this issue.</p>
